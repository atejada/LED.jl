# LED

This package comes with a single method called ShowLED that will simply ask for a numnber and then print it's LED representation.

Usage should be as simple as...

ShowLED(12345)

It should return...
   _  _       _  
|  _| _| |_| |_  
| |_  _|   |  _| 

This is my first Julia package and I build it mainly for fun and learning...so yes...it's useless...but who cares -;)

Greetings,

Blag.
